# Web-Map-Application

This project is titled Web Map Application. As the name suggests, it consists of two interactive maps showcasing Covid 19 data with their respective goal. The map labeled "Counts" captures the number of Covid cases within an area. As one clicks on a circle, it indicates to the user the amount. The map labeled "Rates" showcases the rate of Covid cases within a county. As the user hovers over a county, it will display the rate of people per square mile.
